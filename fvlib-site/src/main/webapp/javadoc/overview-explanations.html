<p>The following explanations are for quick reference and are lifted directly from the original <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html">JDepend documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>
<a name="EXnumber">Number of Classes</a>
</h3>
<p>The number of concrete and abstract classes (and interfaces) in the package is an indicator of the extensibility of the package.</p>
<h3>
<a name="EXafferent">Afferent Couplings</a>
</h3>
<p>The number of other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package's responsibility. </p>
<h3>
<a name="EXefferent">Efferent Couplings</a>
</h3>
<p>The number of other packages that the classes in the package depend upon is an indicator of the package's independence. </p>
<h3>
<a name="EXabstractness">Abstractness</a>
</h3>
<p>The ratio of the number of abstract classes (and interfaces) in the analyzed package to the total number of classes in the analyzed package. </p>
<p>The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package. </p>
<h3>
<a name="EXinstability">Instability</a>
</h3>
<p>The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce / (Ce + Ca)). This metric is an indicator of the package's resilience to change. </p>
<p>The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a completely stable package and I=1 indicating a completely instable package. </p>
<h3>
<a name="EXdistance">Distance</a>
</h3>
<p>The perpendicular distance of a package from the idealized line A + I = 1. This metric is an indicator of the package's balance between abstractness and stability. </p>
<p>A package squarely on the main sequence is optimally balanced with respect to its abstractness and stability. Ideal packages are either completely abstract and stable (x=0, y=1) or completely concrete and instable (x=1, y=0). </p>
<p>The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with D=0 indicating a package that is coincident with the main sequence and D=1 indicating a package that is as far from the main sequence as possible. </p>
